# Yolor-EarthVision-Small-Scale-Dataset
Implentation of Yolor algorithm on Our own created dataset named "EarthVision Small Scale Dataset"

   **YOLOR(You Only Learn One Representation)** is a state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm for object detection, different from YOLOv1-YOLOv5 due to the difference in    authorship, architecture, and model infrastructure. In YOLOR, the algorithm basically benefits because of the combination of both explicit and implicit knowledge. We    have used Yolor to detect objects in aerial images by creating our own EarthVision Small Scale dataset which contains categories such as Airplane, Bridge, Vehicle,      Playground, Water-bodies. We have achieved **Accuracy** of over **76%**, **Precision** of **84%**, and **Recall** of over **86%**.
